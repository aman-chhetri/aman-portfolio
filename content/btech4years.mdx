Hey everyone,

As I stand at the edge of one journey and glance toward the beginning of another, I can’t help but take a moment to reflect on the last four years of my life. After completing my secondary education in Nepal, I took a leap of faith and moved to India to pursue my **Bachelor's in Computer Science**. Little did I know that this decision would shape not only my career but also the person I am today.

These four years have been nothing short of a *rollercoaster*, packed with all the ups, downs, loops, and surprises you can imagine. From late-night assignment marathons and debugging nightmares to cramming weeks' worth of syllabus into sleepless nights before exams, every moment had its own kind of thrill.

But it wasn’t just about academics. Far from it. College life brought with it a whole new world of experiences. I met people from all walks of life—some became friends, some mentors, and some just unforgettable characters in this story. I learned how to communicate, collaborate, compete, and sometimes even compromise. Living away from home taught me independence, responsibility, and the art of surviving with instant noodles and coffee.

Some of the best moments happened outside the classroom—impromptu hangouts, inter-college competitions, hostel pranks, festival celebrations, and those long walks discussing everything from code to dreams. We built more than just projects; we built friendships and memories that will last a lifetime.

Looking back, I genuinely don’t regret a thing. Every deadline panic, every last-minute presentation, every failed attempt was a part of the bigger picture. College wasn’t just about grades and placements—it was about growth, self-discovery, and resilience. It was about figuring life out, one step at a time.

Now, as I get ready to turn the page and step into a new chapter—be it industry, higher studies, or entrepreneurial dreams—I carry with me not just a degree but a story. A story of a young student from Nepal who dared to dream beyond borders, and who found much more than just education in the journey.

*To everyone reading this—whether you're just starting college or in the middle of your own journey—make it count. Embrace the chaos, learn from the challenges, and most importantly, enjoy the ride.*

Until next time, Ciao! 🤍
